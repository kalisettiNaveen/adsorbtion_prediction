Adsorption is one of the important methods for removing hydrogen sulfide from industrial gases and wastewaters.
In recent decades, adsorption has attracted a great deal of attention for purification of environment
Removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from aqueous solutions had been studied using zinc oxide (ZnO) as adsorbent. 
The adsorption capacity of ZnO for H2S from aqueous solutions was determined under various conditions of temperature and solution pH.
Equilibrium data were used to construct adsorption isotherms and to fit various adsorption models. 
Results showed that increasing temperature leads to an increase in the adsorption capacity of oxide. 
The effect of pH on the adsorption was studied and it was inferred that the maximum adsorption capacity of ZnO was attained at pH 7.
The parameters were analyzed and it obeyed the pseudo second order kinetics. Experimental breakthrough curves in a column were obtained with different bed height, flow rate and concentration.
In present investigation the optimum bed height, flow rate and concentration of hydrogen sulfide was found. The Thomas model and BDST model had been used for the evaluation of column data.
Machine Learning Algorithms were utilized to predict the adsorption capacity without conducting experiments.
Among the three algorithms chosen Decision Tree regression gives better results with more accuracy.
